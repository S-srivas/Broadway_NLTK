Hey, folks! Begging your pardon
'Scuse me, sorry to barge in
Now let's skip the tears and start on the whole
Y'know
Being dead thing
You're doomed, enjoy the singing
The sword of Damocles is swinging
And if I hear your cell-phone ringing
I'll kill you myself
The whole being dead thing
Death can get a person stressed
We should have carpe'd way more diems
Now we're never gonna see 'em
I can show you what comes next
So don't be freaked
Stay in your seats
I do this bullshit, like, eight times a week
So just relax, you'll be fine
Drink your fifty-dollar wine
And take a breath
Welcome to a show about death
You're
You're gonna be fine
On the other side
DIE! YOU'RE ALL GONNA DIE! YOU'RE ALL GONNA DIE!
I'll...
I'll be your guide
To the other side
Though in full disclosure: It's a show about death
Everybody gets on fine here
Like Rodgers, Hart, and Hammerstein here
The women's bathroom has no line here
Just. pee where you want
The whole being dead thing
You're just gonna love the folks here
Yeah, I know you're woke, but you can take a joke here
And every show I do, like, a ton of coke here
The whole-
The whole being dead thing!
Nobody is bullet-proof
"I work out, I eat clean!"
Jesus, pass the Dramamine
Time to face the brutal truth
'Cause we're all on a hitlist
Might not live 'till Christmas
Choke to death on Triscuits
Hey, that just statistics
So take a little break here
Kinda like a wake here
The scenery is fake here
BUT THERE'S A GIANT SNAKE HERE
Welcome to a show about death
You're... you're gonna be fine
THANK YOU!
On the other side
HOW YOU DOIN'?
Not good?
I'll... I'll be your guide
To the other side
Seriously, though, this is a show about
Death is taboo, but it's hardly something new
There's nothing medical professionals can do
'Cept maybe just bill you
If you die while listening to this album
It's still gonna keep playing
There's no destiny or fate
Just a terrifying wait
Filled with people that you hate
And on a certain date, the universe kills you
That's the thing with life
No-one makes it out alive
Toss that body in the pit
"Gosh, it's awful, ain't it tragic?"
"Blah, blah, Bible. Jesus magic."
When you're dead, who gives a shit?
No pilates, no more yoga
"Namaste", you freakin' posers
From the cradle to cremation
Death just needs a little conversation
I have mastered the art (Dies Irae!!)
Of tearing convention apart (Dies Irae!)
So, how about we all make a start (Dies Irae!)
On the whole being dead thing
God, I hope you're ready for a show about death
